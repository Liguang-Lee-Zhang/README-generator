## Description

Developers need to write a README file for every project they create. This process can become repetitive and take away valuable time that could be spent on developing the projects. This professional README generator features command line interface that uses user inputs to several key questions to generate a polished, professional README file. 

## Table of Contents 

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
